Lua 5.1.5 for Nintendo Wii

Installation
------------

Be sure DevkitPPC and libogc is installed and $DEVKITPRO is an exported variable.

Then the usual

cd /to/lua51-wii/dir
make -j <number of processor cores/threads> (eg. -j2)

will build the library and

make install

will install library and header files in your DevkitPro installation folder.

Use
---

Include lua headers in your source files, eg:
#include "lua.h"
#include "lauxlib.h"
#include "lualib.h"

Add -llua to your LIBS in Makefile

If you need file system access, use an external library (for example libfat)
and initalize it before trying to access any files.

TODO / BUGS / Limitations
-------------------------

* Add proper Wii thread support
* Add proper time support
* The stand-alone-interpreter and bytecode-compiler are not build.
* Launching external programs (system()) will likely never work
